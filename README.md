## Themes

I am interested in understanding and characterizing the failure mechanisms of geomaterials such as hydraulic concretes, earth concretes (without cement), rocks, or clays. The philosophy of my research work is to perform field measurements at fine scales (microstructure, kinematics), particularly using 3D imaging (X-ray tomography) during in situ mechanical tests, and to correlate these results with numerical simulations that explicitly account for the complexity of the materials' microstructure.

## Developments

I am part of the development team of a free and open-source software that provides the scientific community with advanced field measurement tools, notably through the implementation of advanced image correlation methods. I am also developing a series of routines that implement local kinematic enrichments via the "Embedded Finite Element Method". These two aspects allow me to work on both the analysis of experimental fields and advanced numerical simulations.

## Related Work

I am also working on the theory of random fields to simulate the randomness of the geometry and topology of microstructures. This more fundamental aspect of my work is currently leading me to establish collaborations with mathematicians.
